# Introducing iGAPS Design System Storybook

iGAPS Design System Storybook is a powerful and intuitive tool for creating, documenting and testing UI components. It provides a central place where designers and developers can view, interact with, and document their design system components.

With iGAPS Design System Storybook, you can easily organize your design system, create and test components, and share them with your team. It's a must-have tool for anyone working on a design system, whether you're a designer, developer, or product owner.

# Getting Started

Getting started with iGAPS Design System Storybook is easy. Follow these simple steps:

## 1. Install iGAPS Design System Storybook

To get started, you'll need to install iGAPS Design System Storybook. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @igaps/storybook
```

## 2. Create a Storybook

Once you have installed iGAPS Design System Storybook, you can create a new Storybook by running the following command:

```bash
npx @igaps/storybook init
```

This will create a new Storybook project in your current directory. You can then add your components to the project and start documenting and testing them.

## 3. Add Components

To add a component to your Storybook, create a new file in the `src/components` directory of your project. You can then import and use this component in your Storybook stories.

```javascript
import { Button } from '../src/components/Button';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
};

export const Primary = () => <Button primary>Primary Button</Button>;
export const Secondary = () => <Button secondary>Secondary Button</Button>;
```

## 4. Document and Test Components

With iGAPS Design System Storybook, you can easily document and test your components. Each story you create in your Storybook provides a visual representation of your component, along with a description and any props or arguments it takes.

You can also use addons to add additional functionality to your Storybook, such as automated accessibility testing or visual regression testing.
