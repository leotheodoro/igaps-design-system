Welcome to the IGAPS Design System repository! This design system is built with React, TypeScript, and Storybook. It utilizes Turborepo for managing multiple related repositories, and uses ESLint for code linting and formatting. 

## Getting Started

To get started with using the IGAPS Design System, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. You can install these tools by following the instructions on their respective websites.

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/igaps-design-system.git
cd igaps-design-system
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the Storybook server and view the design system components, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Storybook server at `http://localhost:6006/.` You can then view and interact with the different components of the design system.
